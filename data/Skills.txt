Responsibilities

Newfield is the U.S. leader in cellular network optimization. They gather analytics from individual phones, build signal loss models, and provide an exploratory network analyzer. As a senior engineer I was responsible for the server architecture, generating traffic maps, UI visualization, and data filtering.

Accomplishments

I designed and implemented a complete refactorization of our geolocated call display, which increased our display limit from 2,000 individual calls to at least 100,000, while increasing the rendering framerate. I designed and implemented the policy-based map binner, which allows new map types to be easily added. I designed and implemented the entire data filtering framework. The filtering code begins with specification parsing in Python, followed by automatically generated C++ code for both client and server libraries.

Responsibilities

Everyday at Target warehouse, I loaded and unloaded trucks as they came in. I had to read labels and manually sort any boxes that wouldn't scan. Also, I would work the belt.

Accomplishments

I had a major impact at this job. If I didn't not use team work to load and unload each truck, there would not be any merchandise in the Target store. Target would not make any money, making it difficult for everyone to keep their job.

5 year contract with a Think Tank Incubator ran by RevTEC

I was offered contractor employment to join a "Think Tank Incubator" that was being offered in North Las Vegas at the Las Vegas International Speedway business park. My job was to bring Software and Embedded Technology to the group. There were (3) companies that were formed and commercialized from the Incubator.

[Briefing of (3) contracted projects]

- Cinetrix: Commercially developed Smart Lithium Portable Battery Power for Hollywood Movie Industry

- SwarmTechnologies: I co-founded, created product line, and secured (4) million in funding. www.smartbeecontrollers.com. Swarm is now in retail stores, and has a maintenance crew on the retail small grower product line.

- RevTEC: worked on Alternate Energy Solutions (Solar, Electric Vehicles, Battery Technology)

Software Engineering

Cinetrix Lithium Battery (Hupla Contract)

December   -     to present contract

Programmed Smart BMS (Battery Management System) device for all Lithium battery chemistries

This involved writing firmware on BMS itself (c programming), and developed GUI application tools for field offices to update software and monitor battery health Cloud service to auth and encrypt transfer new firmware to devices.

Programmed Factory automation tools to QA all new assemblies, and analytic data logger, and report tools. The client tools were cross platform (OSX written in c++ and Qt.

Programmed low cost WiFi dongle to embedded board, wrote auto provisioning code on device and gateway to register to network. It sends out health data, and alerts when low battery or proactive bad cell, and other irregularity patterns. Can also adjust thresholds over the network. (LV, HV, OC, OT etc.)

Software Engineer / co-Founder

Swarm Technologies

Nov 2012 to    

SwarmTechnologies was formed and designed a line of wireless mesh network electronic Nodes. The features of the product line are connecting isolated low cost 8 and 32 bit microprocessor chips to an 802.15.4 wireless mesh network cluster. This greatly extends the access and SMART management of previously isolated and independent islands of devices.

The product received traction in the agricultural industry and now preparing a retail launch at www.smartbeecontrollers.com

The technical aspects of the solution involve a 4-tier architecture of which I designed and implemented all 4 tiers independently (budget startup) with the exception of other contractors for graphics design, and html5 layout assistance for WebClient (invaluable combination)

Tier1: software onboard the sensor devices (c

Tier2: software for embedded linux main gateway device (embedded arm processor)

Tier3: software for cloud linux server (debian) using GO language webservices

Tier4: software for client front end. The primary device is Android 4.x tablet. I started with a Web based html5 client, and currently working on the native Android 4.x application.

The power of the embedded networking incorporate AutoDiscovery of nodes as they come on and go offline by assigning leases to each unique node. The wireless Java and c libraries incorporate Zigbee protocol stack, capable of errorRecover, self Healing, adaptive failover routing algorithms. It is a very reliable and robust network for such a low cost environment.

The software monitors real time data, datalogs to an embedded gateway database, and replicates to cloud systems via GPB binary transfer system. The client shows real time event based data, as well as a query engine for historical data analytics. The data is then graphically displayed in chart and summary form to digest vast amounts of information in a fast to interpret visual representation.

Upon completion of the electronics control and mesh product technology above, i have spent the last year subcontracting to a large alternate energy company, and applied many of the software features to their EV new automobile design, and battery technology. Here are the highlights of the most recent contract.

I worked with a large team and implemented software based on their project needs

50th year anniversary Icon Vehicle Electric Model (NDA permits more info)

• Design Software Interface to CAN controlled Curtis Electric Motor Controller

• Embedded Linux SBC to Can controller

• Qt c++ User Interface design and current implementation for Car Touch Console

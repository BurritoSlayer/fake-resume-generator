Sr Software Engineer
Newfield Wireless, Inc
-
Berkeley, CA
-

  2009 to   2012

Responsibilities

Newfield is the U.S. leader in cellular network optimization. They gather analytics from individual phones, build signal loss models, and provide an exploratory network analyzer. As a senior engineer I was responsible for the server architecture, generating traffic maps, UI visualization, and data filtering.

Accomplishments

I designed and implemented a complete refactorization of our geolocated call display, which increased our display limit from 2,000 individual calls to at least 100,000, while increasing the rendering framerate. I designed and implemented the policy-based map binner, which allows new map types to be easily added. I designed and implemented the entire data filtering framework. The filtering code begins with specification parsing in Python, followed by automatically generated C++ code for both client and server libraries.

Everyday at Target warehouse, I loaded and unloaded trucks as they came in. I had to read labels and manually sort any boxes that wouldn't scan. Also, I would work the belt.

Accomplishments

I had a major impact at this job. If I didn't not use team work to load and unload each truck, there would not be any merchandise in the Target store. Target would not make any money, making it difficult for everyone to keep their job.

H_List: Internet Classifieds Project - https://murmuring-stream-8350.herokuapp.com

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, HAML, CSS, SASS, MiniTest, Bootstrap, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. This app allows all users to view listings of items or services for sale whereas only authenticated users are authorized to post. User registration, login, and authentication were created using the devise gem. will_paginate was used for pagination and the validates_email_format_of gem was used to validate email format. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

Portfolio Project - https://secure-depths-9422.herokuapp.com/

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, HAML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Bootstrap, MiniTest, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. Employs static pages to display my portfolio, resume, and information about me. HAML, ERB, SASS, and Bootstrap were used for presentation. Tested using the default Rails testing stack. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

Twitter Clone Project- https://ancient-everglades-3119.herokuapp.com

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, ERB, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Bootstrap, MiniTest, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. This app uses a custom authorization and authentication system to allow users to create accounts and log in. It requires that they be authenticated before accessing certain pages such as the profile. Once logged in, they can post short messages, with pictures if they prefer. Created using Ruby on Rails and online resources. Registration, login, account activation, and password reset functionalities were written from scratch. The carrierwave and mini_magick gems were used to upload images. Mailers were used to send emails to users for account activations and for password resets. Created using tests and test-driven development (TDD) and the default Rails testing stack. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

Nov 2012 to    

SwarmTechnologies was formed and designed a line of wireless mesh network electronic Nodes. The features of the product line are connecting isolated low cost 8 and 32 bit microprocessor chips/boards to an 802.15.4 wireless mesh network cluster. This greatly extends the access and SMART management of previously isolated and independent islands of devices.

The product received traction in the agricultural industry and now preparing a retail launch at www.smartbeecontrollers.com

The technical aspects of the solution involve a 4-tier architecture of which I designed and implemented all 4 tiers independently (budget startup) with the exception of other contractors for graphics design, and html5 layout assistance for WebClient (invaluable combination)

Tier1: software onboard the sensor/control devices (c/c++)

Tier2: software for embedded linux main gateway device (embedded arm processor)

Tier3: software for cloud linux server (debian) using GO language webservices

Tier4: software for client front end. The primary device is Android 4.x tablet. I started with a Web based html5 client, and currently working on the native Android 4.x application.

The power of the embedded networking incorporate AutoDiscovery of nodes as they come on and go offline by assigning leases to each unique node. The wireless Java and c libraries incorporate Zigbee protocol stack, capable of errorRecover, self Healing, adaptive failover routing algorithms. It is a very reliable and robust network for such a low cost environment.

The software monitors real time data, datalogs to an embedded gateway database, and replicates to cloud systems via GPB binary transfer system. The client shows real time event based data, as well as a query engine for historical data analytics. The data is then graphically displayed in chart and summary form to digest vast amounts of information in a fast to interpret visual representation.

Upon completion of the electronics control and mesh product technology above, i have spent the last year subcontracting to a large alternate energy company, and applied many of the software features to their EV new automobile design, and battery technology. Here are the highlights of the most recent contract.

I worked with a large team and implemented software based on their project needs

My job was to bring Software and Embedded Technology to the group. There were (3) companies that were formed and commercialized from the Incubator. [Briefing of (3) contracted projects] - Cinetrix: Commercially developed Smart Lithium Portable Battery Power for Hollywood Movie Industry - SwarmTechnologies: I co-founded, created product line, and secured (4) million in funding. www.smartbeecontrollers.com. Swarm is now in retail stores, and has a maintenance crew on the retail small grower product line. - RevTEC: worked on Alternate Energy Solutions (Solar, Electric Vehicles, Battery Technology)  Software Engineering Cinetrix Lithium Battery (Hupla Contract) December 2015 - July 2016 to present contract  Programmed Smart BMS (Battery Management System) device for all Lithium battery chemistries  This involved writing firmware on BMS itself (c/c++ programming), and developed GUI application tools for field offices to update software and monitor battery health/logs/alerts, Cloud service to auth and encrypt transfer new firmware to devices.  Programmed Factory automation tools to QA all new assemblies, and analytic data logger, and report tools. The client tools were cross platform (OSX/Linux/Win32) written in c++ and Qt.  Programmed low cost WiFi dongle to embedded board, wrote auto provisioning code on device and gateway to register to network. It sends out health data, and alerts when low battery or proactive bad cell, and other irregularity patterns. Can also adjust thresholds over the network. (LV, HV, OC, OT etc.) Software Engineer / co-Founder Swarm Technologies Nov 2012 to January 2015  SwarmTechnologies was formed and designed a line of wireless mesh network electronic Nodes. The features of the product line are connecting isolated low cost 8 and 32 bit microprocessor chips/boards to an 802.15.4 wireless mesh network cluster. This greatly extends the access and SMART management of previously isolated and independent islands of devices.  The product received traction in the agricultural industry and now preparing a retail launch at www.smartbeecontrollers.com  The technical aspects of the solution involve a 4-tier architecture of which I designed and implemented all 4 tiers independently (budget startup) with the exception of other contractors for graphics design, and html5 layout assistance for WebClient (invaluable combination)  Tier1: software onboard the sensor/control devices (c/c++) Tier2: software for embedded linux main gateway device (embedded arm processor) Tier3: software for cloud linux server (debian) using GO language webservices Tier4: software for client front end. The primary device is Android 4.x tablet. I started with a Web based html5 client, and currently working on the native Android 4.x application.  The power of the embedded networking incorporate AutoDiscovery of nodes as they come on and go offline by assigning leases to each unique node. The wireless Java and c libraries incorporate Zigbee protocol stack, capable of errorRecover, self Healing, adaptive failover routing algorithms. It is a very reliable and robust network for such a low cost environment.  The software monitors real time data, datalogs to an embedded gateway database, and replicates to cloud systems via GPB binary transfer system. The client shows real time event based data, as well as a query engine for historical data analytics. The data is then graphically displayed in chart and summary form to digest vast amounts of information in a fast to interpret visual representation.  Upon completion of the electronics control and mesh product technology above, i have spent the last year subcontracting to a large alternate energy company, and applied many of the software features to their EV new automobile design, and battery technology. Here are the highlights of the most recent contract.  I worked with a large team and implemented software based on their project needs  50th year anniversary Icon Vehicle Electric Model (NDA permits more info) • Design Software Interface to CAN controlled Curtis Electric Motor Controller • Embedded Linux SBC to Can controller • Qt c++ User Interface design and current implementation for Car Touch Console • Interface with CAN buttons, and switches on vehicle to eliminate Wiring Harness complexity  Solar Recharge Lithium Iron Phosphate Mobile Power Station • Integrate our power management controls into a mobile solar generator trailer solution for Rapid Response to any emergency energy requirements.

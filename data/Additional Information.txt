Skills

I have many skills that will help me out in this internship. The strongest

skills would be knowing how to work in a professional work space and how to

write to business in a professional manner. I have gained these skills from being

an officer in FBLA and being the Vp of Communications.

I also have learned great soft skills in professional verbal communication.

An example was the time I went to talk to StarGazers Limousines. When I got

home after talking to them I saw I got a email from my Adviser Ms.Fryar. When I

opened the email is was a forwarded email for StarGazers and they told Ms.Fryar

that I was very professional. Also being a highschool teacher himself, he said it's

impressive to see that high school students can still be super profreshional and

talk to grownups in such a good manner. This made me feel like I accomplished

a lot and that I was ready for a professional working environment one day.

Other skills I have is the ability to speak in front of big crows and informing

them of important events and dates. Also being an officer I have learned to write

great meeting minutes notes. I can multitask well with being able to listen and

write down important dates during a meeting and having them typed down for the

other officers to see their tasks.

H_List: Internet Classifieds Project - 

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, HAML, CSS, SASS, MiniTest, Bootstrap, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. This app allows all users to view listings of items or services for sale whereas only authenticated users are authorized to post. User registration, login, and authentication were created using the devise gem. will_paginate was used for pagination and the validates_email_format_of gem was used to validate email format. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

Portfolio Project - 

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, HAML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Bootstrap, MiniTest, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. Employs static pages to display my portfolio, resume, and information about me. HAML, ERB, SASS, and Bootstrap were used for presentation. Tested using the default Rails testing stack. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

Twitter Clone Project- 

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, ERB, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Bootstrap, MiniTest, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. This app uses a custom authorization and authentication system to allow users to create accounts and log in. It requires that they be authenticated before accessing certain pages such as the profile. Once logged in, they can post short messages, with pictures if they prefer. Created using Ruby on Rails and online resources. Registration, login, account activation, and password reset functionalities were written from scratch. The carrierwave and mini_magick gems were used to upload images. Mailers were used to send emails to users for account activations and for password resets. Created using tests and test-driven development (TDD) and the default Rails testing stack. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

IoT Lead Software Engineer

Hired to solve a current failed attempt at a Digital Ceiling Gateway product.



Using the GO language as the chosen technology, I transformed (2) earlier generations of wireless mesh and PoE light fixtures , I developed a multi tiered microservice Gateway, enabling Sensor and Actuator communications to the device network. Utilizing microservices I was able to decouple code bases on a more modularized functional design.

Utilized gRPC service calls, using GPB (google protocol buffers) as the marshaling standard for microservice communication. I unified multiple different binary position protocols. I also defined a new GPB TCP end device that could also be configured to use JSON over TCP

The public side of the Gateway utilized HTTP Rest API, WebSockets and public facing Message Queues for event subscription. A client SDK was also developed to provide a fast start for all new adopting developers.

MQTT and WebSocket tunneling was leveraged to penetrate from inside out, corporate firewall configurations in full compliance using CA signed certificates.

Choosing GO compiled language supporting multiple processor platforms and operating systems turned out to be a great decision. We now have (3) gateways products as part of the suite, ranging from ARM for small system sub $30 gateway, to a super server having (8) network ports and a quad core X86 processor. Final MicroServices were Dockerized (www.docker.com) as containers and built with High performance using concurrency and parallel programming were achieved.

I developed the first version of the TCP endpoints, using (3) processor families.

Esp32 running FreeRTOS, mediaTek 7688 running OpenWRT and NXP MX6 processor using Yocto to build the linux system.

Instrumental in converting waterfall development into Agile development methodologies focused on 6 month release plan. V2.0 Gateway won Product of the Year for the International Light Fair Convention in Philadelphia    .



Upon completion and achieving the award for Product of year above, was promoted as lead Architect for the Embedded Team and the Middleware Gateway.

• Time Series Databases (TSDB)

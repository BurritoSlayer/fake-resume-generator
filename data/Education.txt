ProDeGe: a computational Protocol for fully-automated Decontamination of Genomes
 . .com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fismej%2Fjournal%2Fv10%2Fn1%2Ffull%2Fismej 100a.html&h=8f5ab5b5

Single amplified genomes and genomes assembled from metagenomes have enabled the exploration of uncultured microorganisms at an unprecedented scale. However, both these types of products are plagued by contamination. Since these genomes are now being generated in a high-throughput manner and sequences from them are propagating into public databases to drive novel scientific discoveries, rigorous quality controls and decontamination protocols are urgently needed. Here, we present ProDeGe (Protocol for fully automated Decontamination of Genomes), the first computational protocol for fully automated decontamination of draft genomes. ProDeGe classifies sequences into two classes—clean and contaminant—using a combination of homology and feature-based methodologies. On average, 84% of sequence from the non-target organism is removed from the data set (specificity) and 84% of the sequence from the target organism is retained (sensitivity). The procedure operates successfully at a rate of ~0.30 CPU core hours per megabase of sequence and can be applied to any type of genome sequence.

Computational Science and Engineering Online (CSE-Online): A Cyber-Infrastructure for Scientific Computing

With the expansion of the Internet and World Wide Web (or the Web), research environments have changed dramatically. As a result, the need to be able to efficiently and securely access information and resources from remote computer systems is becoming even more critical. This paper describes the development of an extendable integrated Web-accessible simulation environment for computational science and engineering called Computational Science and Engineering Online (CSE-Online;  cse-online.net). CSE-Online is based on a unique client-server software architecture that can distribute the workload between the client and server computers in such a way as to minimize the communication between the client and server, thus making the environment less-sensitive to network instability. Furthermore, the new software architecture allows the user to access data and resources on one or more remote servers as well as on the computing grid while having the full capability of the Web-services collaborative environment. It can be accessed anytime and anywhere from a Web browser connected to the network by either a wired or wireless connection. It has different modes of operations to support different working environments and styles. CSE-Online is evolving into middleware that can provide a framework for accessing and managing remote data and resources including the computing grid for any domain, not necessarily just within computational science and engineering.

Skills

I have many skills that will help me out in this internship. The strongest

skills would be knowing how to work in a professional work space and how to

write to business in a professional manner. I have gained these skills from being

an officer in FBLA/DECA and being the Vp of Communications.

I also have learned great soft skills in professional verbal communication.

An example was the time I went to talk to StarGazers Limousines. When I got

home after talking to them I saw I got a email from my Adviser Ms.Fryar. When I

opened the email is was a forwarded email for StarGazers and they told Ms.Fryar

that I was very professional. Also being a highschool teacher himself, he said it's

impressive to see that high school students can still be super profreshional and

talk to grownups in such a good manner. This made me feel like I accomplished

a lot and that I was ready for a professional working environment one day.

Other skills I have is the ability to speak in front of big crows and informing

them of important events and dates. Also being an officer I have learned to write

great meeting minutes notes. I can multitask well with being able to listen and

write down important dates during a meeting and having them typed down for the

other officers to see their tasks.

Thank you for considering my candidacy.

I enjoy collaborating with people and building creative solutions.

I possess a broad range of skills and interests that would fit well with this role, including:

• Technology Adoption Orchestration : More than 25 years of varied hardware and software technology design and development experience with platform technology companies including Motorola, Microsoft, VMware, and Apple. At Microsoft, I served as a Developer and Solutions Architect within literally dozens of technology adoption engagements and in collaboration with partner OEMs, ISVs, and Enterprise customers.

• Project Planning : At VMware, I led a global-scoped project implementing a customized Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) solution and enabling new business initiatives supporting organizational maturation from traditional IT to managed services.

• People + Process + Technology : Significant experience planning, organizing, developing, and delivering projects within diverse cross-team collaboration scenarios requiring new role definition, new workflow specification, and introducing new automation.

• Stakeholder Communications : An ability to collaborate directly with executive sponsors, business development managers, and technical leads in complex multi-party engagements and creating business initiatives, technology roadmaps, on-boarding plans, along with business and technical training.

• Creative Omnivore : Creative abilities beyond software development including technical writing, technical training, and RFP/SOW creation.

Sincerely,

Phil

H_List: Internet Classifieds Project - https://murmuring-stream-8350.herokuapp.com

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, HAML, CSS, SASS, MiniTest, Bootstrap, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. This app allows all users to view listings of items or services for sale whereas only authenticated users are authorized to post. User registration, login, and authentication were created using the devise gem. will_paginate was used for pagination and the validates_email_format_of gem was used to validate email format. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

Portfolio Project - https://secure-depths-9422.herokuapp.com/

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, HAML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Bootstrap, MiniTest, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. Employs static pages to display my portfolio, resume, and information about me. HAML, ERB, SASS, and Bootstrap were used for presentation. Tested using the default Rails testing stack. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

Twitter Clone Project- https://ancient-everglades-3119.herokuapp.com

Uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, ERB, CSS, SASS, Javascript, Bootstrap, MiniTest, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku. This app uses a custom authorization and authentication system to allow users to create accounts and log in. It requires that they be authenticated before accessing certain pages such as the profile. Once logged in, they can post short messages, with pictures if they prefer. Created using Ruby on Rails and online resources. Registration, login, account activation, and password reset functionalities were written from scratch. The carrierwave and mini_magick gems were used to upload images. Mailers were used to send emails to users for account activations and for password resets. Created using tests and test-driven development (TDD) and the default Rails testing stack. Deployed using PostgreSQL and Heroku.

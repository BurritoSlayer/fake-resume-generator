October   to Present

User Management System: Restful APIs for Cloud Backend

Key Skills: Java 8, Golang, M-Queue, Datastax Cassandra, Linux Bash scripts, Web Security, Rest Services, HBase, Redis, Git.

Involved in ground up development of User Management module for the cloud backend services. This includes development of a list of Restful APIs for the various http actions that can be performed by a user and Admin. Performed the design, documentation and development of routes, handlers, authorization server and data-layer with best restful practices. The routes and logic layer implementations were done using Golang. Redis an in-memory data structure store was used to manage the sessions and cache data. Implemented Data-layer using DataStax library of Cassandra in Java.

Cloud Authorization Server Development and Session Management:

Key Skills: OAuth2 - Hawk &amp; Bearer, Access tokens, refresh tokens, one time password, Golang, Java, AWS EC2, Redis, JWT, JSON, Rest Services

Developed restful APIs to support features like token blacklisting, refresh token, OTP login.

• Token blacklisting invalidates a currently active user session by isolating the JTI of the JWT and setting a new key into the Redis with this JTI. When the authorization server detects this key, it denies access to the API's

• Designed an One-Time-Password (OTP) based login mechanism to provide access tokens. The Authorization server sends an OTP to the client's phone or email and validates this value. On Successful validation a Bearer token is returned based on the request. This involves using the AWS SNS services to send OTPs to the devices.

IOT Crash Report System:

Key Skills: AWS S3, AWS IAM, Golang, gocql, Cassandra, Angular.

Working on developing services for collecting, processing and displaying crash reports from IOTs.

• The device submits the crash report to AWS S3 through pre-signed signature urls. On successful submission a storage record is also shared with the backend system.

• The Backend system developed using Golang handles User authentication, generation of the S3 signature urls and identifiers for each crash record.

• A GUI developed in Angular will provision user account authentication and interface to download the crash reports based on sophisticated filtering.

Anti-theft Service Development for IOT:

Key Skills: Push Servers, DataStax Cassandra, Redis, Golang, Java

Engineered the cloud backend system to support anti-theft features for an IOT device like Remote lock, ring and wipe. This involved collaborating the requirements of cross-functional engineering teams like Push, UI and Device to frame a solution that fits them all.

Backend developments for the following requirements were made:

• Enabling device to get access token from cloud with which it can access Push server

• For a device to share the endpoint it obtained from the Push server to the cloud.

• To handle the antitheft service request made from website which checks for subscription from cloud Database and eventually enables the device to ring or lock.

HBase to Cassandra Database Migration:

Key Skills: Cassandra Data modeling, Java, Golang and Bash.

Efficiently handled migration of cloud services from HBase to Cassandra. To support the migration, I architected the Cassandra Keyspaces and Tables after methodical analyses of the existing data model and foreseeing the upcoming business requirements. I ensured optimum read and writes occur between the data-layer and the DB by carefully modeling the partition keys and clustering columns in Cassandra.

The Migration also involved development of a number of utilities in Java, Golang and Bash scripts to move the existing data from HBase &amp; Redis to Cassandra.

Mozilla Location Based Services:

Key Skills: Golang, Ichnaea, MYSQL Cluster, AWS EC2, AWS load Balancers.

Ichnaea is a Mozilla open source Location Based service, which provides the Geo Location coordinates by using data from Bluetooth, cell or Wi-Fi networks. I solely handled the development of cloud front end in Golang to perform payload validation and routing to call the Ichnaea REST API's. This includes setting up a highly available MySQL NDB Cluster to support the service which comprises of a cluster of AWS EC2 instances for load balancers, MySQL clients, Management nodes and data nodes.

Server Deployment Scripts in Bash: Developed bash scripts to enable easy deployment of source code to the cloud, scripts to enable server bounce and to start individual services from a local machine.

Database Encryption: Implemented symmetric cryptography at the data layer level of the cloud to encrypt the underlying user data in Cassandra. This was achieved with a minimal hit in the performance of the cloud.

• Implemented a Big Data Architecture model on wealth management, which analyzes the current market demand and suggests a minimum risk investment strategy to the users.

ACADEMIC PROJECTS AT SDSU:

• Real Time Semaphore Performance Analysis in UNIX GCC:

Implemented a Client-Server program for a UDP Datagram application to generate and send datagrams at a specified rate. The data packets are measured and throughput is calculated by the packets lost. Also implemented a semaphore to analyze the average time it takes to lock and unlock and to understand how it affects the performance.

Campus Energy Forecasting: It's a research effort on data mining which focused on building a energy forecast model using previous years data obtained from smart meters and predict consumption peaks. This involved various sets of data preparation, data modeling and training. We implemented small linear models and evaluated the results.

• Global Weather Modeling: Built a Lorenz 5D model using Python SciPy ecosystem to study the impact of higher wavenumber modes on numerical predictability. This focused on achieving a more stabilized Lorenz solution with increased degree of non-linearity.

• Data Compression using Arithmetic Coding: Implemented an Arithmetic Encoder in Python, to show how a higher compression ratio is achieved in Arithmetic Compression when compared to the widely used Huffman codes.

TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE









Senior Full Stack PHP Developer (Ubuntu Server)
Xennsoft LLC
-

November   to    

By far one of the most challenging opportunities I've faced in my entire career. Not only was I responsible for more infrastructure, I was also pushing my abilities and constantly learning new technologies. New

technologies I've worked with at this position: Chef, Percona, Git (Setting up a Repo, Committing,

Branching, Merging, etc), Magento 1.9, Object Oriented programming (HEAVY use of this with the way Magento is designed), Laravel, Ubuntu Server. The skills I brought to the table were good, but I leveled up so much at this job that I feel more confident than ever to tackle anything a job

throws at me. I used the usual LAMP stack ( PHP5, PHP7, HHVM, Ubuntu, Javascript,

JQuery, some Prototype, HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Web Design, Node.js). I will eternally

be grateful to Xennsoft for giving me this opportunity to grow and become a well-rounded

developer. I still have a lot to learn, but now I have a better toolset to work with.

* A bit of a side note: This position was originally onsite. Xennsoft could not find good senior

PHP devs in the Utah area, so they decided to implement remote work. I am currently working

remotely and have been for going on 8 months. Remote work has it's pros and cons, but for the most part I am comfortable with either onsite or remote work. It doesn't matter to me, as long as

I can code. We use Slack, Google Meet, Trello, and a plethora of Google services to communicate with teammates. It has worked quite well.

Full Stack PHP Developer (Windows *shivers*)

  2014 to November  

At Spotlight I worked on maintenance as well as new development for PHP applications running on a stack I've never used before: Windows. To be honest, it wasn't my cup of coffee. I'm much more

comfortable with Linux servers, so this job was the most challenging job I've had. I made internal

applications, and consumer facing applications. I coded for mobile and desktop. I utilized YouTube APIs,

MLS APIs (Real estate db type stuff), PHP5, Bootstrap, JQuery, Javascript (non-Ecmascript), CSS,

Mysql, and HTML5. I also had to hack a few Coldfusion scripts to interact with PHP scripts. It was very outside my comfort zone, but I got it done. I'm not a strong graphic designer, but this job position called

for a full stack web developer. I did my best to create good looking web apps. That's when I found out about Bootstrap. I worked alongside the main developer who had over 10 years experience doing full

stack web development. I absorbed as much knowledge from him, and even taught him a thing or two

(i.e.: strategy design pattern). Before I got onboard with the company, they didn't use any sort of code

versioning software. I helped them implement an SVN repository, after a failed attempt at getting a git

repo started (I'm now more competent with Git as a result of my experience at Xennsoft LLC). Overall, a positive experience.

ProDeGe: a computational Protocol for fully-automated Decontamination of Genomes


  9,  

Single amplified genomes and genomes assembled from metagenomes have enabled the exploration of uncultured microorganisms at an unprecedented scale. However, both these types of products are plagued by contamination. Since these genomes are now being generated in a high-throughput manner and sequences from them are propagating into public databases to drive novel scientific discoveries, rigorous quality controls and decontamination protocols are urgently needed. Here, we present ProDeGe (Protocol for fully automated Decontamination of Genomes), the first computational protocol for fully automated decontamination of draft genomes. ProDeGe classifies sequences into two classes—clean and contaminant—using a combination of homology and feature-based methodologies. On average, 84% of sequence from the non-target organism is removed from the data set (specificity) and 84% of the sequence from the target organism is retained (sensitivity). The procedure operates successfully at a rate of ~0.30 CPU core hours per megabase of sequence and can be applied to any type of genome sequence.

Computational Science and Engineering Online (CSE-Online): A Cyber-Infrastructure for Scientific Computing


  1, 2006

With the expansion of the Internet and World Wide Web (or the Web), research environments have changed dramatically. As a result, the need to be able to efficiently and securely access information and resources from remote computer systems is becoming even more critical. This paper describes the development of an extendable integrated Web-accessible simulation environment for computational science and engineering called Computational Science and Engineering Online (CSE-Online;  CSE-Online is based on a unique client-server software architecture that can distribute the workload between the client and server computers in such a way as to minimize the communication between the client and server, thus making the environment less-sensitive to network instability. Furthermore, the new software architecture allows the user to access data and resources on one or more remote servers as well as on the computing grid while having the full capability of the Web-services collaborative environment. It can be accessed anytime and anywhere from a Web browser connected to the network by either a wired or wireless connection. It has different modes of operations to support different working environments and styles. CSE-Online is evolving into middleware that can provide a framework for accessing and managing remote data and resources including the computing grid for any domain, not necessarily just within computational science and engineering.

Job Title: Loading the cars

● Responsibilities: Making sure the right basket gets in the right car and making sure we make things more efficient for people and less

stressful

● Responsibilities: Making sure if any people have questions or concerns

that we know how to reassure them and tell them that we have everything under control and they don't need to worry.

Activities

I'm a very involved with my school and the activities the high school has to offer. As for sports I used to be in 6 sports a year and still kept a 3.5 grade

average. I no longer do that much sports because I thought it would be best if I

focused on school work and learning for about the business fields. Currently I am

only in Track, Soccer, and Golf for sports. For our golf team we have lots of guys but for girls there is only 2 girls and I am one of them because of this, I believe I

know how to work with guys on a team as while with girls. For soccer I am a

goalie and because of this I believe that I have a lot of responsibility on my

shoulders. With having this responsibility I know that I can handle having that

weight on my shoulders.

Besides for the sports I am also apart of a few clubs at our wonderful

school. One of the clubs I'm in is Key Club. In this club it is a community service

baised club and is the junior club of Kiwanis. I first joined this club my sophomore

year and since then I'm still a member and being active within the club.

The second club I am apart of and is my personal favorite club is

FBLA In this club we do Many things but we have 3 major categories.

Community service, competition, and social activities. For community service we

try to do as much as we can. My favorite community service event is Jeans For

Teens. For this event I got the opportunity to work with business and asking if

they would let our club have a donation box outside their building. Because of this I had to learn how to write an official and professional business letter.

I also am very involved with our competition in both FBLA and DECA. For

FBLA comp. I have competed in business relations and client services. For both events I got 4th place out of 12 competitors. As for DECA I've competed in Hotel and lodging for a year and retail merchandising for the past two years now. And

this year I have advanced on to state to retail merchandising. Along with this

event I am also doing an only state event called Wisconsin Gold Student where I

write an 85 page scrapbook about my achievements in DECA. With the scrap

book I then also have to write a 10 minute speech and make a poster about the scrap book and my achievements.

Finally for social activities my favorite event has to be the Prom Fashion

show we host. For this event My job was to contact business and asking if they

wanted to come and be vendors for the day. Went we finished the event I had to help write thank you card to the vendors.

Overall I am very involved but know how to manage my time and make

sure things run smoothly.

Activity Leadership position

● FBLA Officer to the club, Vp of Communications

-In this position I write the meeting minutes and help build

connections with our partnerships and make connections with new businesses.

● Key Club: Officer of sophomore class

-During my sophomore I was an officer for this club. In this position I

made sure that the kids in my class are involved in our club.

Skills

I have many skills that will help me out in this internship. The strongest

skills would be knowing how to work in a professional work space and how to

write to business in a professional manner. I have gained these skills from being

an officer in FBLA and being the Vp of Communications.

I also have learned great soft skills in professional verbal communication.

An example was the time I went to talk to StarGazers Limousines. When I got

home after talking to them I saw I got a email from my Adviser Ms.Fryar. When I

opened the email is was a forwarded email for StarGazers and they told Ms.Fryar

that I was very professional. Also being a highschool teacher himself, he said it's

impressive to see that high school students can still be super profreshional and

talk to grownups in such a good manner. This made me feel like I accomplished

a lot and that I was ready for a professional working environment one day.

Other skills I have is the ability to speak in front of big crows and informing

them of important events and dates. Also being an officer I have learned to write

great meeting minutes notes. I can multitask well with being able to listen and

write down important dates during a meeting and having them typed down for the

other officers to see their tasks.

Ruby on Rails Developer
Bear Den Designs
-
Jacksonville, FL
-

    to    

Worked on a large legacy Rails application by managing its architecture, designing and developing features, troubleshooting and fixing bugs, and utilizing Test Driven Development (TDD) to ensure everything was well tested before deployment.

Wrote scripts to accomplish scheduled tasks such as parsing the contents of CSV files before validating and importing them into the database, and simplifying complex code for customer service to use in helping users.

Practiced agile development with daily standup meetings to discuss project statuses and give or get help where helpful; pair programmed with other developers; created shippable code for the customer to try before further refinement; and received code reviews from the lead developer upon project submission (pull requests).

In a typical workflow the first step in a new feature would be to research possible implementations and plan a concept with drawings and pseudocode. Once planned I wrote failing tests, then the code to make them pass, then refactored as needed. After the entire test suite was confirmed to pass, the project would be submitted for code review in a pull request. After discussing the notes with the lead developer they would be implemented, the test suite run again, and if everything passed then the code would be deployed to production using Capistrano.

Upgraded Rails and debugged the various gem failures that resulted. Upgraded individual gems such as Liquid and rewrote the local models that depended on the older version. Wrote tests to capture bugs before :ixing them then made them pass. Used Solr for search and wrote rake tasks to customize its use to the app. Created a new class with factories and scripts in both Ruby and Bash to automate the creation of a new demo account to showcase the app and many of its features to potential clients to play with. Wrote documentation for some features and trained the team in other ones.

Designed and Implement a digital gateway for IoT devices



Using the GO language as the chosen technology, I transformed (2) earlier generations of wireless mesh and PoE light fixtures , I developed a multi tiered microservice Gateway, enabling Sensor and Actuator communications to the device network. Utilizing microservices I was able to decouple code bases on a more modularized functional design.

Utilized gRPC service calls, using GPB (google protocol buffers) as the marshaling standard for microservice communication. I unified multiple different binary position protocols. I also defined a new GPB TCP end device that could also be configured to use JSON over TCP

The public side of the Gateway utilized HTTP Rest API, WebSockets and public facing Message Queues for event subscription. A client SDK was also developed to provide a fast start for all new adopting developers.

MQTT and WebSocket tunneling was leveraged to penetrate from inside out, corporate firewall configurations in full compliance using CA signed certificates.

Choosing GO compiled language supporting multiple processor platforms and operating systems turned out to be a great decision. We now have (3) gateways products as part of the suite, ranging from ARM for small system sub $30 gateway, to a super server having (8) network ports and a quad core X86 processor. Final MicroServices were Dockerized (www.docker.com) as containers and built with High performance using concurrency and parallel programming were achieved.

Swarm Technologies

Nov 2012 to    

SwarmTechnologies was formed and designed a line of wireless mesh network electronic Nodes. The features of the product line are connecting isolated low cost 8 and 32 bit microprocessor chips to an 802.15.4 wireless mesh network cluster. This greatly extends the access and SMART management of previously isolated and independent islands of devices.

The product received traction in the agricultural industry and now preparing a retail launch at www.smartbeecontrollers.com

The technical aspects of the solution involve a 4-tier architecture of which I designed and implemented all 4 tiers independently (budget startup) with the exception of other contractors for graphics design, and html5 layout assistance for WebClient (invaluable combination)

Tier1: software onboard the sensor devices (c

Tier2: software for embedded linux main gateway device (embedded arm processor)

Tier3: software for cloud linux server (debian) using GO language webservices

Tier4: software for client front end. The primary device is Android 4.x tablet. I started with a Web based html5 client, and currently working on the native Android 4.x application.

The power of the embedded networking incorporate AutoDiscovery of nodes as they come on and go offline by assigning leases to each unique node. The wireless Java and c libraries incorporate Zigbee protocol stack, capable of errorRecover, self Healing, adaptive failover routing algorithms. It is a very reliable and robust network for such a low cost environment.

The software monitors real time data, datalogs to an embedded gateway database, and replicates to cloud systems via GPB binary transfer system. The client shows real time event based data, as well as a query engine for historical data analytics. The data is then graphically displayed in chart and summary form to digest vast amounts of information in a fast to interpret visual representation.

Upon completion of the electronics control and mesh product technology above, i have spent the last year subcontracting to a large alternate energy company, and applied many of the software features to their EV new automobile design, and battery technology. Here are the highlights of the most recent contract.

IoT Lead Software Engineer

Hired to solve a current failed attempt at a Digital Ceiling Gateway product.



Using the GO language as the chosen technology, I transformed (2) earlier generations of wireless mesh and PoE light fixtures , I developed a multi tiered microservice Gateway, enabling Sensor and Actuator communications to the device network. Utilizing microservices I was able to decouple code bases on a more modularized functional design.

Utilized gRPC service calls, using GPB (google protocol buffers) as the marshaling standard for microservice communication. I unified multiple different binary position protocols. I also defined a new GPB TCP end device that could also be configured to use JSON over TCP

The public side of the Gateway utilized HTTP Rest API, WebSockets and public facing Message Queues for event subscription. A client SDK was also developed to provide a fast start for all new adopting developers.

MQTT and WebSocket tunneling was leveraged to penetrate from inside out, corporate firewall configurations in full compliance using CA signed certificates.

Choosing GO compiled language supporting multiple processor platforms and operating systems turned out to be a great decision. We now have (3) gateways products as part of the suite, ranging from ARM for small system sub $30 gateway, to a super server having (8) network ports and a quad core X86 processor. Final MicroServices were Dockerized (www.docker.com) as containers and built with High performance using concurrency and parallel programming were achieved.

I developed the first version of the TCP endpoints, using (3) processor families.

Esp32 running FreeRTOS, mediaTek 7688 running OpenWRT and NXP MX6 processor using Yocto to build the linux system.

- Web-based reporting: to consolidate reporting into single location with similar look and feel. Easy to manipulate and understand. Drive action.

- Reporting data store: consolidated ERP and user-created data into local repository via custom ETL application.

- Visual Factory: real-time reporting for the factory floor.

- Company-wide Wiki: document the "tribal knowledge" that runs the plant including the ever growing reporting infrastructure.

Consistently pushing myself to learn new technologies and techniques that would allow me to produce better value and content. Examples include:

products using TI integrated circuits. Incorporate legacy tools into a cohesive platform that can

expand into many new creation and analysis features.

Contract Software Developer
Well Log Oil Exploration
-

  2008 to   2010

Facing the layoffs at Syngence, I contacted the lawyer who owned the assets for Lawrence

Technologies. There are several technologies in the proof of concept stage, that could be

rewritten as a proof of product and then find software companies interested in the technology.

Re-targeted the Syngence search software to work on Well Logs for the oil and gas industry.

Developed a patented approach to encoding Well Log data into fuzzy tokens that could be isolated into regions of high-information. These regions are the most likely areas for the existence of hydrocarbons. Also developed a patented approach to visualizing a field (or reservoir) according to its information profile.

Director Advanced Architectures
-

  2006 to   2008

Developing a search technology for the legal industry. Synthetix is a patented search technology which can find a paragraph in millions of pages of text. The key advantage it has over a boolean

search engine (like google) is that it can take a whole paragraph as an input.

Rewrote their search engine, making it more scalable and 10x faster.

I designed and developed an alternative version of Synthetix that will find near-duplicate documents in a very large corpus. Synthetix ND is still their primary product. Due to financial difficulties, they

were forced to lay off the entire development team.

Created a distributed solution across multiple platforms using RMI interfacing with a Java Server

Page running on a Tomcat server with an AJAX user-interface. This allowed the search

technology to scale.

Vice President of Development - Neural Modeling
Correlithm Object Technology
-

  2004 to   2006

I left my career at TI to build software no one had ever built before. The job was to turn the inventions of Nick Lawrence into product prototypes. Nick's technology was called Corob theory.

see the book "Correlithm Object Technology" 

Technology-Nick-Lawrence

I managed to speed up all their technology by at least 10x. Using C++ and the flexibility of templates.

But the company fell into hard times. The financial backer died and the shake up was tumultuous to say the least.

EDA Software Manager
Integrated Circuit Design Tools at Texas Instruments
-

  1996 to   2004

Returned to TI to manage a team tasked with creating a suite of tools to support a new design style

called Dynamic Logic. Lead a small team of experts in several aspects of EDA to create a study and a plan for an entire flow.

I left this group when an opportunity to design a new kind chip configuration capability. The

approach was a declarative language that described the design blocks and produced a hierarchical

netlist. This is like MDA for chip design.

After that, I went to work in the DSP Architecture team, to produce tools for better architecture

planning and estimation. I developed an XML based GUI generator that would allow rapid

development of estimation tools to support each new technology and architecture. I also

developed an approach to using XML to produce message sequence charts (MSC) that modeled the standards for wireless protocols. From the MSC, we could generate C simulators. This too is a form of MDA, for chip design.

Project Manager - Wafer Fab Manufacturing Scheduler
Motorola Semiconductor
-

  1994 to   1996

Lead a small team of scheduling experts to create an implementation of a wafer fab scheduling tool.

This was based on Motorola patented technology. The steering team for this project consisted of three Motorola VPs, including the one who was the patent holder.

The project was done using Common Lisp on both the Mac and Unix platforms. We successfully

implemented the technology into our initial target fab. But applying the technology to all of

Motorola's fabs, turned out to be problematic. Each fab had differences in scheduling process. I

recommended that the company should engage in a program of wafer fab process improvement.

Worked with the scheduling experts to re-target the CMM model of process improvement to fab

scheduling.

I was offered the job of leading the process improvement effort, but felt that the scheduling experts

were better suited to that work. It would have been very much a non-software position.

Software Developer
R&D Chip Design Tools at Texas Instruments
-

  1988 to   1994

Joined TI to work on an integrated set of chip design (EDA) tools. Using object-oriented Lisp

(Flavors) we developed a complete chip design tool suite. Initially I developed the timing analysis

tool. Having no prior background in EE, I took all the requirements from a senior chip designer.

After completing the Timing tool, I worked with a senior member of the team to over haul the tool

integration component. I developed all the common components of the system. Based on a

mechanism I created for lazy data creation (to manage space) I integrated an OODB, which was

being developed by TI R&amp;D.

I moved to TI R&amp;D after the integrated tool set was scrapped in favor of commercial EDA

tools. There I developed mpeg4 algorithms, neural network and fuzzy logic chip simulators. I

implemented a complete MPEG2 transcoder.

Knowledge Engineer
Truck Manufacturing
-

  1988 to   1988

Went to work on a 30 person effort to develop an expert system for manufacturing trucks. While

everyone else was more educated than I was, I took an automated approach to rule creation.

Instead of entering the rules from my expert, I created an interface that would allow me to write a

spec that could generate the rules.

Initially this unique approach raised some concerns until I demonstrated that the results produced

my entire rule set in 20% of the time allowed in the schedule and that time included writing the rule

generator.

This demonstrated that the automated approach might be more broadly applied. With the help of one other developer, we wrote a program that generated the entire rule set overnight. This was

based on an existing conventional database of manufacturing constraints that was already in use.

The result of my work caused the entire project to be redirected into small teams to implement AI

solutions for each area of the manufacturing process.

Software Developer - Space Station Experiment Scheduler
NASA
-

December 1985 to December 1987

While still in college, I went to work at a small AI shop producing expert systems for NASA and the

NRC. I also created their expert system tool set, including a frame based object system and an inference engine. Wrote a successful SBIR proposal for real-time scheduling of battlefield power

managment.

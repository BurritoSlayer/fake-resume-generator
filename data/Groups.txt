I have many skills that will help me out in this internship. The strongest

skills would be knowing how to work in a professional work space and how to

write to business in a professional manner. I have gained these skills from being

an officer in FBLA/DECA and being the Vp of Communications.

I also have learned great soft skills in professional verbal communication.

An example was the time I went to talk to StarGazers Limousines. When I got

home after talking to them I saw I got a email from my Adviser Ms.Fryar. When I

opened the email is was a forwarded email for StarGazers and they told Ms.Fryar

that I was very professional. Also being a highschool teacher himself, he said it's

impressive to see that high school students can still be super profreshional and

talk to grownups in such a good manner. This made me feel like I accomplished

a lot and that I was ready for a professional working environment one day.

Other skills I have is the ability to speak in front of big crows and informing

them of important events and dates. Also being an officer I have learned to write

great meeting minutes notes. I can multitask well with being able to listen and

write down important dates during a meeting and having them typed down for the

other officers to see their tasks.
